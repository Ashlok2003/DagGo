    <h2>ðŸš€ Hello from Dagger + Go!</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Go</strong> is a fast, simple, and efficient programming language created by Google.
      Itâ€™s widely used for cloud-native applications, web servers, and systems programming thanks to
      its concurrency model and powerful standard library.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dagger</strong> is a modern CI/CD engine that lets you define pipelines in code.
      With Dagger, you can build, test, and deploy your Go apps in repeatable, containerized steps.
